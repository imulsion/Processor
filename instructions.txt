	INSTRUCTION FORMAT
	[0 bit][opcode 5 bits][argument1 13 bits][argument2 13 bits]
	-Each instruction takes up 4 bytes of memory

	
	
	PROBLEMS FOR REPORT
	-Forgot to include <array> leading to loads of errors
	-Forward declaration crap with that memory pointer in byte
	-mention all the problems with dependencies in memory and byte (ie byte operators had to access sreg)
	-mention decisions regarding RAM size and instruction length
	-bool& vs const bool& for the array access thing from the byte class
	-Addition operator was subtracting because when harry told me to change it to += I was modifying data[i] which was then used by carry - needed a temp copy
	-Optimisations by doing the whole += thing - no copies so more efficient code, also using const references so they're read only
	-const corrected the operator[] function: allows compiler to optimise more freely, guarantees to compiler data wont be changed
	-without const corrected operator[] compiler assumes it will change the data to be safe
	-lots of stuff about const correctness and optimisation - code is now very efficient
	-word vs byte addressing
	-stuff about mar and mdr
	-optional for bus representing high impedance mode
